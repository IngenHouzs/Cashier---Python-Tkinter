
There's nothing much to set up unless database.
-If you don't want to create 'Cashier SQL' folder, you can cut it (Line 99, 603, 622, 643, 648 - gui.py).
-By the way, you can clear the queries ONLY ON "ClientSide Query.sql". DO NOT TOY WITH OTHER FILES, UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

Make sure you have required module installed.
